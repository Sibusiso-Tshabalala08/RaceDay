RaceDay — Event Management System 

Overview 

RaceDay is a full-stack, web-based event management system built for South Africa's road running, walking, and cycling community. It replaces the paper-based registration, spreadsheets, and disconnected communication that many local race organisers currently rely on. 

The platform allows Event Organisers to create and manage events, define entry categories, and capture participant results. Participants can browse upcoming events, enter events by selecting a category, track their personal performance history, and prepare for race day using live weather and route information. 

This repository contains Part 1 of the RaceDay Portfolio of Evidence: system planning, including the database design (ERD), the API endpoint plan, and the SQL database script. No application code is written in this part — Parts 2 (RESTful API) and 3 (MVC web application) build on top of this foundation. 

User Roles 

RaceDay supports two distinct user roles: 

Organiser — can create, edit, and delete events; manage event categories; capture participant results; and view all enrolments for their own events. 

Participant — can create an account, browse events, enter an event by selecting a category, view their own enrolments, and track their own results. 

Role-based access will be enforced at the API level in Part 2 and reflected consistently in the MVC interface in Part 3.

Part 1 Deliverables 

1. Entity Relationship Diagram 

Located at docs/RaceDay_ERD.png. Models 6 entities: Roles, Users, Events, Categories, Enrolments, and Results, with primary keys, foreign keys, and cardinality shown for every relationship. 

A few deliberate design decisions worth noting: 

Users is a single table with a RoleId foreign key (rather than separate Organiser/Participant tables), since both roles share identical attributes — the difference in permissions is enforced at the application layer, not the schema layer. 

Events includes Latitude/Longitude (to support the live weather feature) and RouteMapUrl (to support Azure Blob Storage integration in Part 3), even though those features aren't built until later parts — this avoids schema changes further into the project. 

Categories supports both age-based (e.g. "Under 20", "Senior") and distance-based (e.g. "10km", "21km") categories via a CategoryType field, with Distance or MinAge/MaxAge populated accordingly. This is enforced with a CHECK constraint in the SQL script. 

Enrolments enforces one enrolment per participant per category via a UNIQUE(ParticipantId, CategoryId) constraint. 

Results has a Status field (Finished/DNF/DNS/DQ) and nullable FinishTime/Position, since not every participant who enrols finishes the race. 

2. API Endpoint Plan 

Located at docs/RaceDay_API_Endpoint_Plan.md. Covers all required areas — Authentication, User Profile, Events, Categories, Event Enrolments, and Results — with HTTP method, route, description, required role, request body, and expected response (including failure cases) specified for every endpoint. 

3. SQL Database Script 

Located at docs/RaceDay_Database.sql. 

Setup Instructions — Running the Database Script 

Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and connect to your local or remote SQL Server instance. 

Open a new query window. 

Open docs/RaceDay_Database.sql and execute it. 

The script will:  

Create a new RaceDay database (if one doesn't already exist) 

Create all 6 tables with primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints 

Seed the database with sample data: 2 Organisers, 2 Participants, 3 Events, 6 Categories, 4 Enrolments, and 3 Results 

To verify, expand Databases → RaceDay → Tables in Object Explorer, or run: 

sql 

  SELECT * FROM RaceDay.dbo.Events; 

No additional setup (no application code, no dependencies) is required for Part 1, since this part is planning and database design only. 

CI/CD 

A GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/validate-repo-structure.yml) runs automatically on every push to main. It validates that the /docs folder exists and contains the ERD, API endpoint plan, and SQL script, and that a README is present.
